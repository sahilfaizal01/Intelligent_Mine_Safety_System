# Intelligent_Mine_Safety_System

Due to many people dying in mine accidents, the mine safety plays a key role in the mine production process. By virtue of recent advancements in the Internet of Things, this paper proposes an intelligent monitoring system for coal mines, which aims at monitoring the coal mine production process. Nowadays due to global warming and climate changes there are challenging situations in the coal mine field. To lessen the cost and improve the profitability alongside item quality the automation in the field of coal mine-shaft is in reality vital, which will likewise decrease the diggers endeavors. 
The project consists of two modules that are the Arduino UNO and the NODE Red dashboard. The Arduino UNO is equipped with various sensors such as Rain Sensor,Flame Sensor , Soil Moisture Sensor ,Gas Sensor ,DHT11 Sensor ,Air Pressure Sensor. The arduino is connected to a MQTT sensor which sends the sensor data to a NODE red dashboard for real time monitoring and analysis for raising alerts.
